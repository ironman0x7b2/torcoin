\begin{abstract}
The scalability of the Tor Anonymity Network suffers from the lack of an
incentive to volunteer bandwidth resources, which are required for the system to
operate effectively. This paper identifies the challenges and issues involved in
producing such incentives, and proposes an architectural design with acceptable
trade-offs that can be realized with mostly existing technologies.
