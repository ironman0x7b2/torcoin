	High level TorCoin system architecture for clients and relays. A 
	\textit{TorPath Client} assigns Tor circuits to clients via the TorPath
	protocol, described in the next section. A \textit{TorCoin Miner} mines
	TorCoins 	and stores them in a \textit{TorCoin Wallet}. Each \textit{Tor
	Client} and 	\textit{Tor Relay} operates as usual, but on circuits assigned
	via the TorPath 	protocol.
