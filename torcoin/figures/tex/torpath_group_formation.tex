  \caption{Both relays and clients use onion-encryption to encrypt their own
temporary public keys with the public keys of all the assignment servers in the
group. (a) Each client generates one keypair, and sends its public key onion-encrypted
to the server. (b) Each relay generates multiple keypairs, to support
multiple clients and/or circuit positions within a consensus group,
as instructed by the assignment servers.}
