\section{Introduction}

The Tor network suffers from slow speeds, due to a shortage of relay nodes from
volunteers. This is a well studied problem, but despite many attempts, there is
not yet a widely-adopted mechanism for compensating relay operators while
retaining anonymity of clients~\cite{raykova- pet2008, wpes09-xpay,
incentives-fc10, ccs10-braids, acsac11-tortoise, jansen2013lira,
johnson2013onions}.
This paper outlines one possible solution, embodying two complementary
novel ideas:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
\textbf{TorCoin} is an alternative cryptocurrency, or
altcoin, based on the Bitcoin protocol\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. Unlike
Bitcoin, its proof-of-work scheme is based on bandwidth rather than
computation. To ``mine''  a TorCoin, a relay transfers bandwidth
over the Tor network. Since relays can sell  TorCoin on any existing altcoin
exchange, TorCoin effectively compensates them for  contributing bandwidth to
the network, and does not require clients to pay for  access to it.
\\
\item
\textbf{TorPath} is a secure bandwidth measurement mechanism
that utilizes decentralized groups of ``Assignment Servers,''
extending Tor's existing ``Directory Servers,'' to assign each client a Tor
circuit that is publicly verifiable, but privately addressable. This mechanism 
allows TorPath to ``sign'' newly-minted TorCoins, so that anyone can verify a
TorCoin by checking the blockchain. \end{enumerate}
