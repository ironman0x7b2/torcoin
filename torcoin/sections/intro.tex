\section{Introduction}

The Tor network suffers from slow speeds, due to a shortage of relay nodes
from volunteers. This is a well studied problem, but despite many attempts,
there is not yet a widely-adopted mechanism for compensating relay operators
while retaining anonymity of clients~\cite{raykova-
pet2008, wpes09-xpay, incentives-fc10, ccs10-braids, acsac11-tortoise,
jansen2013lira, johnson2013onions}. We present a possible solution, embodying
two complementary novel ideas:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{TorCoin} is an alternative cryptocurrency, or altcoin, based on
the BitCoin protocol\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. Unlike BitCoin, its proof-of-work 
scheme is bandwidth-intensive, rather than computationally-intensive. To ``mine'' 
a TorCoin, a relay transfers bandwidth over the Tor network. Since relays can sell 
TorCoin on any existing altcoin exchange, TorCoin effectively compensates them for 
contributing bandwidth to the network, and does not require clients to pay for 
access to it.
\\
\item \textbf{TorPath} is a method for decentralized groups of ``Assignment
Servers,'' which extend traditional ``Directory Servers,'' to assign each client a Tor circuit that is publicly verifiable, but privately addressable. This mechanism 
allows TorPath to ``sign'' newly-minted TorCoins, so that anyone can verify a TorCoin by checking the blockchain.
\end{enumerate}
