\section{Proposed Architecture} \label{arch}

\subsection{Overview}

\input{figures/tex/architecture.tex}

The TorCoin architecture implements the novel TorCoin and TorPath protocols. We
describe both in later sections, but in brief, the TorCoin protocol mines coins,
and the TorPath protocol assigns a circuit (entry, middle, and exit servers) to
each client.

TorCoin runs as a standalone service, and requires little modification of the
core Tor codebase. Tor clients and relays operate as usual, but receive circuit
assignments from \textit{assignment servers} instead of directory  servers.
Separately, a \textit{TorCoin Miner} on each machine mines TorCoins by
monitoring the throughput of the local Tor TLS tunnel, and communicating with
its circuit neighbors via the TorCoin algorithm.

Figure \ref{figure:archi} shows a basic overview of this architecture.


\subsection{Adversary Model} We consider the existence of an adversary who
wishes to obtain TorCoins without trnsferring bandwidth. We assume the adversary
is able to control a number of clients and routers. We assume that malicious
clients and routers know about each other's existence and are able to collude.
We also assume that the adversary is able to control a minority of assignment
servers on the network and that the other servers are honest-but-curious.
