\section{TorCoin Architecture} \label{arch}

\input{figures/tex/architecture.tex}

The TorCoin architecture consists of two protocols, TorCoin and TorPath.
In brief, the TorCoin protocol is a BitCoin variant that mines coins,
while TorPath protocol assigns a circuit (entry, middle, and exit servers) to
each client, thereby ``authorizing'' the minting of TorCoins
through verifiable proof-of-bandwidth.

TorCoin runs as a standalone service, requiring little modification to the
Tor or BitCoin codebase. Tor clients and relays operate as usual,
except clients receive circuit
assignments from \textit{assignment servers},
instead of choosing relays arbitrarily from the Tor directory.
Separately, a \textit{TorCoin Miner} on each machine mines TorCoins by
monitoring the throughput of the local Tor TLS tunnel, and communicating with
its circuit neighbors via the TorCoin algorithm.

Figure \ref{figure:archi} shows a basic overview of this architecture.


\subsection{Adversary Model}
We are primarily concerned here with an adversary who
wishes to obtain TorCoins without contributing useful bandwidth
to the Tor network. We assume the adversary
is able to control a number of clients and relays. We assume that malicious
clients and relays know about each other and are able to collude.
We also assume that the adversary is able to control a minority of assignment
servers on the network, and that other servers are honest-but-curious.
