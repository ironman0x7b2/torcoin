\begin{abstract}
The Tor Anonymity Network currently depends on volunteer relay operators for
bandwidth scaling, a model we believe to be unsustainable.
We propose an incentive scheme for Tor that
relies on two novel concepts.
First, we introduce \textit{TorCoin},
an ``altcoin'' that uses the BitCoin protocol to
reward relays for contributing bandwidth.
Relays ``mine'' TorCoins, then sell them for cash
on any existing ``altcoin exchange.''
To verify that a given TorCoin represents actual bandwidth transferred,
we introduce \textit{TorPath},
a decentralized protocol for assigning Tor circuits to clients
using publicly verifiable randomness,
such that each is privately-addressable but publicly verifiable.
