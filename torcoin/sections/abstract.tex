\begin{abstract}
The scalability of Tor Anonymity Network suffers from a shortage of Tor relays, currently provided by altruistic volunteers. We present a method to compensate Tor relay operators and retain anonymity, without charging clients for access. Our solution relies on two novel concepts. First, we introduce \textit{TorCoin}, an ``altcoin'' that uses the BitCoin protocol to reward relays for contributing bandwidth. Relays ``mine'' TorCoins, then sell them for cash on any existing ``altcoin exchange.'' To verify that a given TorCoin represents actual bandwidth transferred, we introduce \textit{TorPath}, a decentralized protocol for assigning Tor circuits to clients, such that each is privately-addressable but publicly verifiable.
