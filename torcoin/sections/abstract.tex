\begin{abstract}
The Tor network relies on volunteer relay operators for relay bandwidth,
which may limit its growth and scaling potential.
We propose an incentive scheme for Tor relying on two novel concepts.
We introduce \textit{TorCoin}, an ``altcoin'' that uses the BitCoin protocol to
reward relays for contributing bandwidth. Relays ``mine'' TorCoins, then sell
them for cash on any existing altcoin exchange. To verify that a given
TorCoin represents actual bandwidth transferred, we introduce \textit{TorPath},
a decentralized protocol for forming Tor circuits
such that each circuit is privately-addressable but publicly verifiable.
Each circuit's participants may then collectively mine
a limited number of TorCoins, in proportion to the end-to-end transmission
goodput they measure on that circuit.
