\section{Future Work and Conclusions} \label{conc}

We have introduced a novel way to securely and anonymously assign paths to
Tor clients. This scheme was motivated by the need to verifiably sign TorCoins,
a bandwidth measurement scheme that incentivises bandwidth throughput over the Tor network. The TorCoin protocol is robust to malicious relays and clients colluding to mint TorCoins without transferring bandwidth. 

Further work could investigate the use of cryptographic accumulators for
circuit signatures, which could reduce the packet overhead during bandwidth-measurement and make the protocol more efficient.
