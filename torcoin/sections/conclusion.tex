\section{Future Work and Conclusions} \label{conc}

We have introduced a novel way of to securely and anonymously assign paths to
Tor clients. This scheme was motivated by a bandwidth measurement scheme that
incentivises the bandwidth throughput over the network. The TorCoin protocol
is robust to malicious relays and clients colluding to mint TorCoins without
transferring bandwidth. The next step will be to implement the TorCoin system
and measure its performance under various conditions and its robustness to
various kinds of attack.

Further work will also investigate the use of cryptographic accumulators for
circuit signatures and ElGamal shared secrets to sign the TorCoin packets.
This would reduce the packet overhead during bandwidth-measurement and make
the protocol more efficient.
