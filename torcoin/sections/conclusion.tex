\section{Conclusions} \label{conc}

We have introduced TorPath, a novel scheme to assign paths to Tor
clients securely and anonymously.
TorPath motivated by the need to verifiably mine TorCoins, a
a Bitcoin variant based on measured bandwidth over the Tor network.
The TorCoin protocol is robust to malicious relays and clients
colluding to mint TorCoins without transferring bandwidth.

\com{	This is a very minor optimization,
	not worth mentioning if it's the only "Future Work" listed. -baf
Further work could investigate the use of cryptographic accumulators for circuit
signatures, which could reduce the packet overhead during bandwidth-measurement
and make the protocol more efficient.
