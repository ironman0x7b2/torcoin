Todo - DRAFT NOTES:

This section will detail the economic model and present any lingering questions. There will be another diagram featuring multiple clients, a PSP, and multiple hosts. The diagram below will go into the software architecture section, under a section called ``system design'', followed by a sentence describing each component. Then we will go into detail on the ephemeral paths and TorCoin design, which are part of the TorCoin Minter. The TorCoin trader, wallet, and exchange are all necessary, but not novel in terms of design, so we will spend little time on those.

TODO: Add component to Client, ``TorCoin Minter'' (?)
